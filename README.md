# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-using-ML-code
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting 60% of people over
the age of 50 years. Patients with Parkinson’s (PWP) face mobility challenges and
speech difficulties, making physical visits for treatment and monitoring a hurdle. PD
can be treated through early detection, thus enabling patients to lead a normal life. The
rise of an aging population over the world emphasizes the need to detect PD early,
remotely and accurately. We employ advanced data preprocessing techniques to clean
and prepare the data for analysis, followed by feature selection to identify relevant
biomarkers associated with PD. In this project, we propose a machine learning-based
approach for the detection of Parkinson's disease using biomedical data. The dataset
comprises various modalities, including voice recordings, collected from individuals
with and without PD. It uses machine learning techniques in telemedicine to detect PD
in its early stages. As a result, various machine learning techniques and Python libraries
are employed in order to develop a model capable of reliably detecting the presence of
disease in one's body. Comparison of results of classification by Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic
Regression models, yield Random Forest classifier as the ideal Machine Learning (ML)
technique for detection of PD. Random Forest classifier model has a detection accuracy
of 0.983%. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in aiding early
diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease, contributing to improved healthcare
outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals. So, we aim to promote the use of
ML in telemedicine, for providing a new lease of life to patients suffering from
Parkinson’s disease.
